Exercises
You could write the function get_mae yourself. For now, we'll supply it. This is the same function you read about in the previous lesson. Just run the cell below.

def get_mae(max_leaf_nodes, train_X, val_X, train_y, val_y):
    model = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_leaf_nodes=max_leaf_nodes, random_state=0)
    model.fit(train_X, train_y)
    preds_val = model.predict(val_X)
    mae = mean_absolute_error(val_y, preds_val)
    print(mae)
    return(mae)
    
    Step 1: Compare Different Tree Sizes
Write a loop that tries the following values for max_leaf_nodes from a set of possible values.

Call the get_mae function on each value of max_leaf_nodes. Store the output in some way that allows you to select the value of max_leaf_nodes that gives the most accurate model on your data.

candidate_max_leaf_nodes = [5, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500]
# Write loop to find the ideal tree size from candidate_max_leaf_nodes
scores = {leaf_size: get_mae(leaf_size, train_X, val_X, train_y, val_y) for leaf_size in candidate_max_leaf_nodes}

# Store the best value of max_leaf_nodes (it will be either 5, 25, 50, 100, 250 or 500)

best_tree_size = min(scores, key=scores.get)

# Check your answer
step_1.check()

Step 2: Fit Model Using All DataÂ¶
You know the best tree size. If you were going to deploy this model in practice, you would make it even more accurate by using all of the data and keeping that tree size. That is, you don't need to hold out the validation data now that you've made all your modeling decisions.

# Fill in argument to make optimal size and uncomment
final_model = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_leaf_nodes=best_tree_size,random_state=1)

# fit the final model and uncomment the next two lines
final_model.fit(X,y)

# Check your answer
step_2.check()
